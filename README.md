This extension adds support for ANTLR4 grammar files, which includes these features:

* Syntax coloring for ANTLR grammars (.g and .g4 files).
* An own color theme, which not only includes all the [recommended groups](http://manual.macromates.com/en/language_grammars), but also some special rules for grammar elements that you don't find in other themes.
* Syntax and some semantic error checking (symbol matching)
* Quick navigation via ctrl/cmd+click.
* The symbol list for quick navigation (via shift+ctrl/cmd+O).
* Hovers (tooltips) with symbol information.

## Extension Settings

Nothing for now.

## Known Issues

* The complete-light color theme is not fully done yet.
