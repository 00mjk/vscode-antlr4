# vscode-antlr4

This extension for Visual Studio code will add support for ANTLR4 grammars.

## Features

At the moment there is not much that works, but plans are to add the following features:

* Syntax highlighting tailored to ANTLR4 grammars (working by using a provided color theme)
* Error checking
* Hovers for symbols
* Code completion
* Code navigation (go to symbol)

## Requirements

This extension requires the antlr4-graps node module (also written by me) which provides the actual language support.

## Extension Settings

Nothing for now.

## Known Issues

Nonthing for now.
