# vscode-antlr4

This extension for Visual Studio code adds support for ANTLR4 grammars.

## Features

This extension adds syntax coloring for ANTLR grammars (.g and .g4 files). Best results are achieved by using one of the provided color themes, but any other color theme will do mostly. With this extension you also get error checking (syntax + symbol checking), go-to-definition and the symbol list for quick navigation. Additionally, hovers (tooltips) are provided to easily show the definition of a symbol ([virtual] lexer tokens, parser rules, modes and channels).

## Requirements

This extension requires the antlr4-graps node module (also written by me) which provides the actual language support. This node module is included in the extension.

## Extension Settings

Nothing for now.

## Known Issues

The complete-light color theme is not fully done yet.
